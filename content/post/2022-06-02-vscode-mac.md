## Using Latex on macOS

Download MacTex (~3/4 GB with most packages included), via homebrew, support for Apple Silicon

## Guide

I followed mostly [VSCODE CONFIG LATEX (MAC)](http://homepages.rpi.edu/home/36/wangy52/public_html/PersonalWebsite/build/html/Misc/Mac/VSCode/VSCode-LaTeX.html), which is quite comprehensive and easy to follow.

The only adjustment I need is the directory for skim location `/opt/homebrew/bin/` if installed via homebrew.

Also don't delete `syntex.gz` file as it's required for bi-directional jumping between VSCode and Skim.
