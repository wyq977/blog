## Trouble with VPN (Loon)

Though the filter rule support local and self-defined resource parser, GeoIP resolver, etc. 
I still came across many times where I had trouble with Loon enabled.

This is one of easiest case involved, I would like certain app to follow certain policy,
such as `REJECT`, `DIRECT` or `proxy (added)`.

It can be achieved as followed, where all the traffic via Facebook app will be blocked.

```
[Rule]
USER-AGENT,com.facebook.Facebook,REJECT
```
