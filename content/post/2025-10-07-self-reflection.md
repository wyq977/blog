title: "Should I Change My Old Files' Names"

## TLDR

__No!__ Just keep working and stop trying making every files perfect!

1. all lower case
2. date should be 2022-07-19
3. connecting should be dash "-"

It's has been a while since I wrote, both in work and in my spare time.
I have been hesitent about the title of post or should I say article.
The original is very self-reflective and somehow vague: "Self Reflection Fall 2025".
Wow! That reads super personal and in some ways sounds like a patient' log by the end of 2025.
I would start with a age-old question for programmer/coders (with some OCDs)

>How do you name you files?

## File naming

Of course there are different convention and guideline on each programming language and official guidelines for each language.
For example, you need to indent properly but the naming can get wild

```
camelCase
CamelCase
File_Title_Case
file_lower_case
file-dash
filealltogether
```

It gets more complicated with adding prefix or suffix of version number, draft, date.
What should one use for date?
Do you go from 'ver_01' to 'ver-02' by coping or just simply modify on the original doc.
