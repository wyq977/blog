It wouldn't so anooying if I only use vscode, nvim or sublime.

Right now, the pylsp plugin in Sublime is very strict: even hightlights the trailing spaces behind each line.

```
VIM - Vi IMproved 9.1 (2024 Jan 02, compiled Jul 20 2025 20:30:35)
```

## Current setup

* installation: macOS, brew, venv, conda
* formatter: brew, vscodium extension, sublime inhouse
* linter: pylint?
* LSP: pyright? where is it installed?

Settings: Globally defined python coding style and project-wise style.
