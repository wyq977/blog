## Motivation

Now the number of devices for me personally is quite low at 2-3: a Mac desktop,
a laptop and a iPhone. But what bothers me the most is rather the number of apps
or services one has to look thr for all the info. Given that I am using media 
and tools from oversea (FB, Reddit, Twitter) and China (微博, 哔哩哔哩), a huge
difference and a sense of in-coordination among them is present every day.

A typical media cursing/consumption for me:
* I checked for videos on YT and bilibili
* I got some news and trending on Reddit and Zhihu
* Search for a particular topic on Weibo or Twitter for the most recent news and
stories.
    * Need to go to some domain-specific site like subreddits or overflow, CSDN,
    etc.

This is probably not the things I would do every time I picked up the phone but
a majority of time is a never-ending battle of my attention. However, my time
and my focus were sold as a commodity and traded between these platforms or
publishers depending on your opinion.

## These thing are not free anymore

As indicated by the title of this video by Tom Scott, you can do wonderful/weird
things at your own will with the services provided by Google, Yahoo, Weibo and 
baidu. But the sad reality is that this trend of opening (wether APIs or others)
is diminishing at a alarming rate when I don't expect I will be easily share 
info. across providers.

Why? Because data farm is costly, even for Microsoft, Google.
