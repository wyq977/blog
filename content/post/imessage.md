Problems (2 iPhones and 1 Mac):

* Tel. A (main,  :white_check_mark: iMessages)
* Tel. B (backup, :x: iMessages)
* email A (login, :white_check_mark: iMessages)
* email B (public, :x: iMessages)

## Avoid spam text messages sync to Mac (no TEXTs from Tel. A)

disable "Enable Messages in iCloud": otherwise texts from **Tel. A** will be synced 

## use iMessage on mac

![](images/imessage_mac_setting.png)

Check "you can be reached for messages at:"

despite you disable in the last setting, iMessages can still arrive while regular text won't.

Right now I can be reached via the gmail, if I checked the **Tel. A**, I can also receive iMessage text on my mac

## sync TEXT message on other iPhone NOT TESTED

both iPhone needs to enable message in iCloud,

I think you need to enable iMessage for the other phone number, not sure tho

update on 2022-04-28, I received a text message (07:55) from **Tel. B** on 11:15 WTF?

## Updated 2022-06-06

On main iPhone with Tel A, I can still receive text from Tel. B on another phone...
