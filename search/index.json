Google Drive, iCloud, Microsoft or some of those smaller ones that claims have better privacy protection and other gimmicks.\nActual setup e-mail: Google PRO: linked with UZH, ETH, Hotmail, I can just use 1 fucking app for all CON: The GFW in mainland China Calendar: Google TBH, I can use Microsoft instead, might be switching to it. TODO: Microsoft Drive: iCloud: Still the best for i-Devices One Drive: Works well with i-Devices and workable in Linux Google Drive: Decide to use less of it as it’s constantly encouraging the sharing functionality Browser: Edge PRO: It really works well in Linux as well as macOS CON: still prefer Safari in iOS Safari’s support for extension is there but just not all the way through like Chromium based ones. You need to pay more for extensions and tools that’s free elsewhere and still not that great. PS. Firefox is dying, sadly. The Problem is choosing between consistency and compatibility a bit info. on the systems that I run daily:\nApple: Mac Mini w/ M1 chip iPhone 11 Pro iPhone XS Max (CN ver.) Linux: Legion 5 Laptop So the simplest way seems to be all in on Apple Ecosystem right?\nBut wait, there’re just so many things that I hate about it. For example, the users do NOT have any control about which version of a specific app they are allowed to use without using 3-rd party tools.\nLet’s assume you put all of your data and info. with Apple system. There’s something that not a lot of people encountered but it’s annoying for people who travel or live in many regions or country.\nThe Tech companies policy does not go well with one person having multiple regions/countries for obvious reasons: tax, regulations and pricing.\nFor the Apple system, my mom and dad’s accounts are in China Mainland but I daily used a US region account. If I used that in China, that’s against the ToS of Apple, Inc. and I do not want to deal with that and certainly do not have the trust of putting all my data with one service.\nThe inconvenience of using different services For privacy reasons, of course one should have different account for different services and they should even use different emails/phone number for different sites or apps. But this level of privacy concerns are simply not gonna fit well with everyday life of an normal person with a moderate level of concerns over his/her privacy.\nSurely one has to give certain info. to the service provider for the convenience or the customization of information feed. Take a look at YouTube on a fresh computer, the home page is full of things that you do not even want to click or hover your mouse over.\nAgain, this is for people that DO want a bit of customization on the recommendation or feeding on platforms like Twitter, YouTube or Facebook. If one were hardcore enough to just use RSS to get his info., then there’s no need for these.\nFor example, you cannot use Google reminder on Apple’s Native apps while Microsoft’s TODO fits well on iOS native app. That’s why I choose Microsoft.\n","date":"2022-09-05T14:25:04+02:00","permalink":"https://wyq977.github.io/p/my-way-of-organizing-cloud/","title":"My way of Organizing Cloud"},{"content":"CRONTAB on macOS It\u0026rsquo;s annoying on macOS that each editing would prompt the pop up for authorization of scheduled task.\n.plist What is it?

Despite its convenience in parameters tuning and data manipulation, it\u0026rsquo;s much more difficult than sharing the list of python packages in other workflows.\nExisting solution Someone used Anaconda environment file but I personally find that a bit too clumsy. I never tried it but I assume if one put R==4.1/4.2 in env.yml, conda will try to download and install a different version inside each env directory.\nHowever, this approach might be a lot more useful if a workflow involves a lot of cli tools such as bwa of different version or self-compiled one.

Quality is quite good since they are not reencoded. The video (H.264 or H.265) and audio (AC3/AAC) streams are usually extracted from the iTunes or Amazon Video and remuxed into a MKV container without sacrificing quality. WEBRip: the file is often extracted using the HLS or RTMP/E protocols and remuxed from a TS, MP4 or FLV container to MKV. Usually WEB-DL is better Bluray: A re-encode of the final released Blu-ray Remux: a rip of a Blu-ray or HD DVD disc to another container format or just stripping the disc of menus and bonus material while keeping the contents of its audio and video streams intact (also keeping the current codecs), guaranteeing the exact 1:1 movie quality as on original disc. HDTV: A re-encode of the final released Blu-ray, but broadcast over HD cable or satellite. This is released usually several months after a retail release, but sometimes upscaled versions of a Standard Definition film are released on cable channels such as STARZ or HBO, and they would be the only HD copies of that specific film available. These are generally MKV or MP4 container.
